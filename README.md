# Mars Rover position predicter

## Setup

This project uses Yarn. If you do not have Yarn available, install it with
`npm i -g yarn`. Run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

## Usage

To predict the location of the rover, pass the paramaters in to stdin. E.g.
`cat test|node index.js`.

## Testing

To run all tests, run `yarn test`

## Overview

I designed the code to be as efficient and minimalistic as possible. There are
multiple unit tests for all the critical functions to ensure correct functioning
even after later modifications.
